Faced with the growing threath of ecological and climate changes on one hand, and the pressure of the international community as well as the local activist groups and movemnts on the other, Serbian government has been pushed to imlement meassures facilitating transition toward the sustainale economy. The article discusses the progress Serbia has made in adoppting and implmenting those meassures, including various factors, both socio-political and economic that influnce the pace of transformation. Besides, it focuses on the effects these meassures might have in adressing challneges the green transition might have on the workers and the quality of emolyment. Conclusions drawn from the analysis of the public policies adopted until now and the reflection on the structural factors influencing their effects, call for the action on behalf of decision makers, progressive movements and social actors to take a more decisevie action in order to be able to tackle more effectively both the enviormental and socio-economic challenges posed by the current processes and developments. </p>\n<p><strong>Published by</strong> portal Mašina<strong>, <a href=\"https://alekslakic.github.io/me/green-jobs-in-serbia.html\" title=\"https://www.google.com/search?client=safari&amp;rls=en&amp;q=ma%C5%A1%C5%A1ina+ima+li+u+srbiji+zelenih+poslova&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8\">link</a></strong></p>\n<h4 class=\"p1\"> </h4>\n<p class=\"p1\"> </p>",
